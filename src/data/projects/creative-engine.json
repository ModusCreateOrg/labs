    "To support development of Genus, we produced Creative Engine that runs on a few systems, including the ODROID GO (ESP32), Desktop Linux and macOS.  To provide the best audio experience, Creative Engine implements a custom music and effects engine that is based off of LibXMP. To further the boundaries this library's delivery, we've even added an exprimental network-based RGB Matrix panel driver affording us the ability to create our own custom display with RGB LED Matrices and Raspberry Pi Single Board Computers (coming soon).",
