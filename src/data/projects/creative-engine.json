    "Creative Engine (CE) was born from the development of our 2018 holiday game, Genus. CE is a game engine that is programmed primarily in C++ and is capable of running the ODROID GO (a portable game platform based on the ESP-32 SOC), desktop Linux and macOS. To provide the best audio experience, CE implements a custom music and effects engine that is based off of a popular chip tunes music library called LibXMP. We furthered the boundaries this CE's capabilities by adding an exprimental network-based RGB LED Matrix display driver, giving us the ability to create a completely custom game play experience.",
