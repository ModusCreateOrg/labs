    "We produced a game engine that is capable of running the ODROID GO (a portable game platform), desktop Linux and macOS for our 2018 Holiday game, Genus.  To provide the best audio experience, Creative Engine implements a custom music and effects engine that is based off of LibXMP. We furthered the boundaries this library's capabilities by adding an exprimental network-based RGB LED Matrix display driver, giving us the ability to create a custom game play experience",
